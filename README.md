CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE PLATFORM DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
#
I created a simple management system using python and mssql. 
<br/>Users can buy currency from the platform or trade it amoung other users these interactions are updated in the database
<br/> Employee have the ability to approve the orders or trades and there are super admins which can add/update/delete the coins in the database
#
To run simply execute the sql quiries in the txt file in sql server mangement studio and run the pyhton code, remember to connect the python code and the database.
